# ODE Solver

#### This program solves an ODE for the Lorenz attractor

##To Build
Just run 'make'. Builds with the GNU c compiler.

##To Run
'./ODE_Solver'

When prompted, input an amount of time and a timestep (on the order of .01 s), then enter appropriate initial conditions. 0, 1.0, 1.05 tends to work well for initial conditions. The output 'data.txt' file can then be put into matlab or gnuplot and the Lorenz attractor can be seen.

Previous output has been graphed in the plots included.
